# Project Requirements

This is a high level description of your project. You should create detailed requirements and update this document
with those requirements. This will guide your development throughout the remainder of the project.

## Recipe Book

No sure what to cook? Turn to the Recipe Book. The recipe book lets users search for a food item 
(like Pasta or Chicken) and it will display a list of suggested recipes that include that food.

Users can create new recipes and add them to the app. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients 
and instructions on how to prepare the food.

But wait... there's more... users can add recipes to their daily or weekly menu and have a schedule 
for what they want to cook. Then, they can create a shopping list of all the ingredients that they 
need to purchase for the week.

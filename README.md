# Final Capstone

No sure what to cook? 

Turn to Honey Butter - Brought to You by the Rolling Scones! 

Honey Butter allows users to search for a food item (like Pasta or Chicken) and will display a list of suggested recipes that include that food item.

Users can create custom recipes and add them to their personal library. Each recipe includes an image, a list of ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare the food.

## Project Design

This is a group project created by [Robin](https://github.com/riotbrrrd), [Jane](https://github.com/jane-le-huynh), and [Roxy](https://github.com/roxyabedi) as part of the Niantic Voyager Bootcamp.

### Design Tools

Tools used for diagramming: 

* Excalidraw - used for wireframing and early-stage UI design
  * sketched out page layouts, navigation flows, and interface components
  * quickly iterated on designs during the brainstorming phase
    
* draw.io - used for entity relationship diagrams for database modeling
  * defined entities (tables) and their attributes (columns)
  * illustrated relationships between entities
  * visualized foreign key constraints and database schema design
  * ensured the integrity and organization of the database structure

### Project Management

* Trello - used for project tasks and workflow
  * created boards to represent the overall project
  * used lists to define phases like Backlog, To Do, Doing, and Done
  * organized individual tasks as cards, with due dates, descriptions, and task assignments

## Front End

## Development Stack

The project utilizes a modern and scalable tech stack, combining backend, frontend, and database technologies to deliver a responsive and efficient web application.

### Backend
* Java: The backend is built with Java, using the Spring Boot framework. It provides RESTful APIs, handles business logic, and manages data persistence.
* Spring Boot: Simplifies Java application development with features like dependency injection, data access, and web security.
* Maven: Dependency management and build automation.
  
### Database
* MySQL: The application uses MySQL as the relational database management system to store and retrieve data. The database is designed with optimized schemas and relationships to ensure data integrity and performance.

### Frontend
* React: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and efficient management of application state.
* TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript, helping to catch errors early in the development process and improving code maintainability.
* Bootstrap: Used for responsive and mobile-first UI design. Provides a grid system, pre-built components, and utilities for consistent styling across the app.
